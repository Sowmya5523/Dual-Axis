Introduction:
A solar photovoltaic (SPV) cells based dual axis tracking system on Arduino Uno                                               
platform is implemented in this project for achieving maximum power during a day. The key 
idea of this article is implementing an automatic dual axis solar tracking system. Alignment of 
solar panel with the Sunlight for getting maximum solar radiation is experimented. This system 
tracksthe maximum intensity of light in terms of maximum power point (MPP). When the light 
intensity decreases, its alignment changed automatically for catching maximum light intensity. 
This project shows implementation and analysis of dual axis solar tracker
The main objective of the dual-axis tracker is to follow the position of the sun for 
maximum energy efficiency. Given that the sun moves at 15 degrees per hour and assuming, 
the tracker would make position changes every 0. 01 seconds, the change in angular velocity 
is calculated. To increase the efficiency of the solar panel by 30-45% when compared to the 
static and single axis solar tracker.
The motivation behind dual axis solar tracking with weather monitoring is to maximize 
the energy output of solar panels while minimizing the impact of weather conditions. This can 
help to make solar energy a more reliable and cost-effective source of renewable energy.

MOTIVATION OF THE PROJECT:
The motivation behind dual axis solar tracking with weather monitoring is to optimize 
the efficiency of solar panels and increase their energy output. Solar panels are most 
effective when they are directly facing the sun, but the sun moves throughout the day, 
which means that the panels are not always in the best position to capture sunlight.
A dual axis solar tracker adjusts the position of the panels both horizontally and 
vertically to keep them pointed directly at the sun as it moves across the sky. This allows 
the panels to capture more sunlight and generate more energy.
However, weather conditions can also affect the efficiency of solar panels. For 
example, cloud cover can reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the panels, and high 
winds can damage the panels or cause them to become misaligned.
By incorporating weather monitoring into the dual axis solar trackingsystem, the panels can be adjusted to compensate for these conditions. For example, if 
cloud cover reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the panels, they can be tilted to a 
steeper
angle to capture more light. If high winds are detected, the panels can be automatically 
stowed in a safer position to prevent damage.
Overall, the motivation behind dual axis solar tracking with weather monitoring is to 
maximize the energy output of solar panels while minimizing the impact of weather 
conditions. This can help to make solar energy a more reliable and cost-effective source
of renewable energy.

Dual-axis solar tracking with weather monitoring has several advantages:
• Increased Energy Production: By using dual-axis tracking, solar panels can follow the 
sun’s movement more accurately and efficiently, resulting in higher energy production. 
This can increase the overall efficiency of the solar panel system.
• Improved Weather Monitoring: With weather monitoring, solar panels can adjust their 
position according to the weather conditions. This means that during periods of high 
winds, the panels can be tilted to reduce wind resistance, thereby reducing the risk of 
damage. Similarly, during periods of heavy rain or snow, the panels can be tilted to
prevent damage or ensure that they continue to operate efficiently.
• Longer Lifespan: Dual-axis solar tracking can extend the lifespan of solar panels by 
reducing stress on the panels. By adjusting the angle of the panels, the stress on the panels 
is reduced, which can help to prevent cracks or other damage that could reduce the 
lifespan of the panels.
• Reduced Costs: While the initial cost of installing dual-axis solar tracking with weather 
monitoring may be higher than traditional fixed solar panels, the increased energy 
production and longer lifespan of the panels can result in significant cost savings over 
time. Additionally, the ability to adjust the panels based on weather conditions can reduce 
the risk of damage, which can also result in cost savings

Dual-axis solar tracking with weather monitoring has a wide range of 
applications, including:
• Residential Solar: Homeowners can use dual-axis solar tracking to increase the energy 
efficiency of their solar panel systems. By following the sun's movement more precisely, 
the system can generate more energy, reducing energy costs and improving 
sustainability.
• Commercial Solar: Dual-axis solar tracking can also be used in larger commercial solar 
panel installations, such as those on factories, warehouses, or office buildings. The 
increased efficiency can help reduce energy costs and carbon emissions, making it an 
attractive option for many businesses.
• Agriculture: Dual-axis solar tracking systems with weather monitoring can be used in 
agriculture to power irrigation systems, pumps, and other equipment. The system can be 
installed on farms, vineyards, or other agricultural properties to generate renewable 
energy and reduce energy costs.
• Remote Locations: Dual-axis solar tracking can also be used in remote locations that 
are not connected to the grid. By generating their own energy, these locations can reduce 
their dependence on traditional energy sources and increase their energy independence.

1CONCLUSION
As solar energy is considered one of the main sources of energy in the near future, In
this project, a simple and concise overview of the solar tracking mechanism to improve 
the solar gain energy, also the costs of the solar tracker operation and cost maintenance is 
relatively low. In this project, Design and implementation of solar tracker with four axes 
that use in motor satellite dish to track the sun accurately and use LDR sensor to determine
the intensity of falling sunlight and found that the solar tracking system is more effective
than the fixed solar panel. The energy gained from the solar panel with the dual tracker 
exceeds 35% of the energy gained from the fixed solar panel, In analyzing the data, the
energy gained from the solar tracker is mostly in the morning and in the evening because 
at noon time there is little difference and this proves that the fixed solar panel is efficient 
during noon time only. The dual-axle solar tracking system is efficient as it can be placed 
anywhere and ensure a high energy gain.
